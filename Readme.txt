Below is data related to hand gestures predictor, my ML model predicts hand gestures of 21 alphabets [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,L,M,N,O,P,R,S,T,U,V,W,Y] given input data as an image from eigtheer a webcam or through gradio interface after you upload a image to interface it will give you the output prediction of what gestures you would have shown. I trained the pretrained model YOLOV5S for 12 epochs and it performed remarkably on custmized hand_gestures dataset with 0.95 recall and precision for training data.below is the link for colab notebook:

and other data is given in this folder below such as dataset and result.csv conatining everything related to performance of model and some charts.
